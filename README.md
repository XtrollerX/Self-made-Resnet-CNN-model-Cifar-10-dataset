# Self-made-Resnet-CNN-model-Cifar-10-dataset
This was my second CNN model I have created. No transfer learning was involved, I got a validation accuracy of around 70% on the Cifar-10 dataset. It is trained for around 8 epochs
# What I have learned
- I have learned how to apply resnet over my CNN model and the concepts behind it
- Batch norms and normalizations to apply to data/features
- Uploading data and models into the GPU
- Utilising dropouts, weight decay, learning-rate scheduler and gradient clipping in the CNN model.
